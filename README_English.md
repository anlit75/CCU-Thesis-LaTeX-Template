# CCU Thesis LaTeX Template
This template is designed for writing master's and doctoral theses at National Chung Cheng University, providing a predefined structure and basic syntax examples for users to refer to. 
Users only need to make adjustments according to their own needs.  
The template has been pre-set with Times New Roman and DFKai-SB as two commonly used fonts.

Please write in the corresponding .tex file based on the content. If you wish to add or remove sections, you can adjust by adding/removing `.tex` files in the "sections" folder.  
Then, in the `main.tex`, use the `\input{./path/to/texfile}` syntax to add new section or delete relevant section accordingly.

## LaTeX Environment Setup
> Before setting up the LaTeX environment, please make sure that you have downloaded this template to your local computer!

There are two ways to set up the environment for users to choose from.
You only need to **install one of them**. It is recommended to use [Docker Environment Setup](#docker-environment-setup) to avoid environment configuration issues.
If you are not familiar with Docker, you can refer to [Local Environment Setup](#local-environment-setup) to install the environment by yourself.

### Docker Environment Setup
- Requirements: `Docker`, `VSCode`
1. Install `Docker Desktop` ( https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop ), and restart your computer after installation.
2. Install `VSCode` and add the extensions `Remote Explorer`, `Dev Containers`, `Docker (optional)`.

#### Create Docker Container
Open `VSCode` in the root directory of the thesis template, and enter the following command in the terminal to create a Docker Container :

```bash
# --name thesis : Specify the container name as thesis (can be changed by yourself)
docker run -itd --name thesis -v .:/home/thesis anlit/thesistex:latest
```

Next, in the `Remote Explorer` extension, you will see the newly created container as shown in the following image.  
Right-click on the `thesis` folder and select `Open in Container in Current Window` to enter the container environment.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./figures/RemoteExplorer.png" alt="Remote Explorer"> <br>
    Remote Explorer - Dev Container <br><br>
    <img src="./figures/attach.png" alt="Open in Container in Current Window"> <br>
    Open in Container in Current Window <br><br>
</div>

Next, you can then use the template according to the [User Guide](#user-guide).

### Local Environment Setup
- Requirements: `MiKTex`, `perl`, `VSCode (option)`
1. Install `MiKTeX` and set it as the default compiler ( https://miktex.org/download ).
2. Install `perl` ( https://strawberryperl.com/ ).
3. Install `VSCode` and add the extensions `LaTeX Workshop` and `LaTeX Utilities`.

> After the installation is complete, VSCode must be restarted!

#### LaTeX Workshop Settings
In the `settings.json` file, you can rearrange the order of the recipes, and the one at the top will be the default compiler.  
Move the group `latexmk (xelatex)` to the top, as shown below:

```json
"latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
    {
        "name": "latexmk (xelatex)",
        "tools": [
            "xelatexmk"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "latexmk",
        "tools": [
            "latexmk"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "latexmk (latexmkrc)",
        "tools": [
            "latexmk_rconly"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "latexmk (lualatex)",
        "tools": [
            "lualatexmk"
        ]
    },
    ...
],

// Optional parameters
"latex-workshop.latex.autoBuild.run": "onSave",         // automatically compile when saving
"latex-workshop.latex.autoClean.run": "onSucceeded",    // automatically clean up when compilation is successful
```

#### LaTeX Workshop SyncTex
In the Keyboard Shortcuts Settings, you can configure the shortcut for `SyncTex` as shown in the image below.  
The default is `ctrl+alt+j`, but you can adjust as needed.

![SyncTex](./figures/synctex.png)

- Press `ctrl+Left-Click` on the text in the PDF file to automatically jump to the corresponding location in the .tex file.
- In the `.tex` file, use `ctrl+alt+j` to automatically jump to the corresponding location in the PDF file.

The actual operation results are demonstrated as follows :

![SyncTex](./figures/sync_demo.gif)

#### LaTeX Utilities Settings
This extension can automatically generate formatted tables and figures when **pasting** into vscode.  
Please paste the following settings in the `settings.json` file :

```json
// The template is automatically applied when `ctrl+v` is used. If it is false, you need to use `ctrl+shift+v`
"latex-utilities.formattedPaste.useAsDefault": false,

// figure template
"latex-utilities.formattedPaste.image.template": [
    "\\begin{figure}[!htb]",
    "\t\\centering",
    "\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{${imageFilePath}}",
    "\t\\caption{${imageFileNameWithoutExt}}",
    "\t\\label{fig:${imageFileNameWithoutExt}}",
    "\\end{figure}",
    ""
],
```

The actual operation results are demonstrated as follows :

![formattedPaste](./figures/paste_demo.gif)
